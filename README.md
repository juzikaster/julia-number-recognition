# Program that can recognize digits from 0-9 using Flux.jl and tkinter from Python


### You cant run this script if Python and Tkinter isn't installed!

###### In video I was using model that trained 20 epochs and its not very at recognizing number, but by default I set 200 so if you want to train it to specific number of epochs you need to change it in the source code
